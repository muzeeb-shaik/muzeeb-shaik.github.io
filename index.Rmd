I am a third year PhD student in the Marketing Department at the [Mays Business School](https://mays.tamu.edu/){target="_blank"} at Texas A&M University. 

My current research focuses on Interfirm Relationships (B2B) and Sales Force Effectiveness. I am co-advised by [Hari Sridhar](https://mays.tamu.edu/directory/shriharisridhar/){target="_blank"} (Texas A&M University) and [Vikas Mittal](https://business.rice.edu/person/vikas-mittal){target="_blank"} (Rice University).
